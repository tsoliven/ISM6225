      <h2>Experience Developing This Website</h2>
      <p>
        Working on this assignment provided hands-on experience in designing a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        My assigned theme was "Luxury Hotel", so I utilized a dark blue and gold color palatte to give off an expensive and luxorious feel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The process included building the page structure and content on HTML and adding styles and layouts using CSS. The mock reservation
        utilizes JavaScript and demonstrates a simplified CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) simulation for interactivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Files were published via <strong>Cyberduck (SFTP)</strong> to <code>public_html</code> on 
        <em>myweb.usf.edu</em> and verified for cross-browser compatibility.
